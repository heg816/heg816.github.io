			<p>C++ was the first language I learned in depth when I decided I wanted to see if having a CS Major was of interest to me. I know write C, C++, Java, and Python, and have an interest in learning Rust. I prefer performance of "middle level" languages like C/C++ and Rust over the flexibility of high abstraction languages. </p>
